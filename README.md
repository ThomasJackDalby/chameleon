# Chameleon

So this project was a Fractal generating exercise I underwent back when I was first learning C#. I think it builds, but it's fairly complex to use.

I'd quite like to update it now, applying what I've learnt in the past few years. More likely, I'll rewrite it from scratch/in a new language.

That being said, it did generate some really sweet images!

Enjoy (:
